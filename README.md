# COMP313-Group-Project

Readme.md in the root of the repo â€“ Brief description outlining the architecture of the game in terms of level structure and game loop. This will include:
links to any libraries or asset origin.
installation and setup instructions ( or just the .exe if you have packaged the project fully)
instructions on how to play/demonstrate the game.

<h2>Level Structure</h2>
<p>
The game has five levels/maps. There is one basic map that is used primarily for testing and four more detailed maps. At launch the player acting as the server can choose the map to be played. There is no level "level up" functionality so all of the maps are accessable all of the time. 
</p>

<h2>Game Loop</h2>
The core game loop revolves around shooting other players while in an arena. The game allows several players to join the same session and control seperate characters in an attempt to shoot and kill each other. The first player to reach eight kills is determined to be the winner.
